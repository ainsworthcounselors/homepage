            As the Ainsworth School Counselors, it is important to us to that we connect with all students!
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Throughout the school year we will be going into classrooms to teach lessons, practicing skills with small
            groups, meeting individually with students, and supporting families with navigating the education system.
            We are also here to advocate for your child’s success. Our services are tailored based on students needs.

                        This year we will focus on mindfulness as a tool for school success by using the MindUP
                        curriculum.
                        We may also cover topics ranging from how to solve problems with friends, goal setting,
                        bullying
                        prevention, and career planning.
                        Guidance lessons are a wonderful way for us to meet and connect with every student.</td>
                    <td class="align-text-top">Students will have opportunities to participate in counseling groups as needed.
                        The groups will address specific growth goals as determined by need including:
                        leadership, problem solving with friends, handling big emotions, dealing with loss, and
                        building
                        empathy.
                        Parents will be notified before their student participates in a group.</td>
                    <td class="align-text-top">We see students when parents, teachers, or the administrators refer them.
                        Students can also make appointments with us by filling out the form on the outside of our door
                        or
                        using the counseling request form below.
                        If parents have a specific concern or reason you want your student to meet with us, please call
                        us, email, or use the counselor request form below.
                        Unfortunately, school counselors do not have the resources to provide on-going therapy, however
                        we can support you in choosing an outside counselor if necessary.
                        It is our goal to meet with every student individually at least once to support them on a
                        personal
                        level.
